## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]** of positive integers, where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are  **m**  students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among m students such that:

- Each student gets exactly one packet.
- The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number is minimum and return that minimum possible difference.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr = [3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12], m = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: The minimum difference between maximum chocolates and minimum chocolates is 9 - 3 = 6 by choosing m packets as [3, 4, 9, 7, 9].

```

```
Input: arr = [7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56], m = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum difference between maximum chocolates and minimum chocolates is 4 - 2 = 2 by choosing m packets as [3, 2, 4].
```

```
Input: arr = [3, 4, 1, 9, 56], m = 5
Output: 55
Explanation: With 5 packets for 5 students, each student will receive one packet, so the difference is 56 - 1 = 55.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMinDiff(int arr[], int m) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.length;
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        if(m ==0 || n==0 ) return 0;
        if(m>n) return -1;
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int i=0;i+m-1<n;i++){
            int diff = arr[i+m-1] - arr[i];
            ans = Math.min(diff,ans);
        }
        return ans;
        
    }
}
```
