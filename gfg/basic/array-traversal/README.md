## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]** of size n that contains integers. Print the elements of the array in a single line with a space between them.

 **Note:**  Don't add a new line at the end.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [54, 43, 2, 1, 5]
Output: 54 43 2 1 5
Explanation: Just traverse and print the numbers.
```
